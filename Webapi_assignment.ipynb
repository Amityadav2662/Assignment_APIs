    "to communicate and interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",

    "weather data from a weather service provider through an API. The app sends a request to the API with the desired location, and\n",
    "the API responds with the weather data, which the app then displays to the user."

    "Advantages of using API:\n",
    "a.Encapsulation: APIs abstract the complexity of underlying systems, allowing developers to interact with them using\n",
    "simplified methods.\n",
    "b.Reusability: APIs enable code reuse by providing standardized interfaces, reducing the effort required to build new \n",
    "applications.\n",

    "a.Dependency: Applications relying heavily on external APIs may experience issues if the API is unavailable, experiences downtime,\n",

    "# Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two architectural styles used for\n",
    "designing web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST Architecture:\n",
    "1. REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources on the web.\n",
    "2. RESTful APIs use resource-based URLs and support multiple data formats, such as JSON and XML.\n",
    "3. It is lightweight, scalable, and widely adopted for building web APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "1. SOAP is a protocol that defines a set of rules for exchanging structured information in web services using XML.\n",
    "2. It relies on a standardized XML-based message format and often uses the HTTP protocol for transport.\n",
    "3. SOAP APIs use a contract-based approach, where the interface is defined in a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Complexity: SOAP can be more complex to implement and understand due to its extensive specification and XML-based messaging format.\n",
    "2.Overhead: SOAP messages tend to be larger in size compared to REST, which can result in higher bandwidth usage and slower performance.\n",
    "3.Limited language support: While SOAP can be used with various programming languages, it is typically more tightly coupled \n",
    "with languages like Java and .NET."
